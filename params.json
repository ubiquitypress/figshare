  "body": "# About the Project\r\nStreamlining Depositing is a City University Centre for Information Science and Ubiquity Press project funded by JISC #DataSpring.\r\n\r\nProject Lead — Ernesto Priego, City University\r\n\r\nLead Developer — Andy Byers, Ubiquity Press\r\n\r\nDeveloper — Mauro Sanchez, Ubiquity Press\r\n\r\nUX/UI — Stephann Makri, City University\r\n\r\nThe project includes output in the form of our plugin but also in the form of best practice documentation and various research outputs.\r\n\r\n# What are OJS and Figshare?\r\nOJS, Open Journal System, is a web application supported by the Public Knowledge Project and is widely used for self/institutionally hosted Journals. Ubiquity Press’ Journal Management System is a customised version of OJS.\r\n\r\nFigshare is an online digital repository where researchers can preserve and share their research outputs, including figures, datasets, images, and videos. It is free to upload content and free to access, in adherence to the principle of open data.\r\n\r\n# How Will it Work?\r\nThe plugin will be hooked into the submission process and will give the user the option to submit their supplementary files to Figshare rather than directly into the Journal. The DOI assigned by Figshare is stored and, on publication of the article, the Editor can select which files should be published alongside the article.\r\n\r\nThe article page will then display title, description and a DOI link to the supp file.\r\n\r\n# Will Others be Able to Use it?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely! We’re building the plugin in the open, it can be found on Github, you’re welcome to clone the project and contribute to it. When the project is complete we will be building a zip release that can be dropped into the OJS plugin installer, but there are instructions on how to install the development version.\r\n\r\nWe will be releasing the software under the GNU v2 License.\r\n",
